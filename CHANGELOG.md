## [3.2.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/3.2.0) - 2026-09-13

### Added

- MOPACPot dlopens the split [mopacc](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/mopacc)
  engine (`libmopacc.so`, OpenMOPAC). Packed `MopacCParams`.
  Default model is AM1.
- NWChem RPC specifications accept basis, theory, exchange-correlation, and SCF
  iteration controls for reproducible electronic-structure requests.
- Skala XC is available as C++ ``SkalaPot``: NWChem DFT through ``libnwchemc``
  with ``dft.xc`` defaulting to ``skala-1.1``. Enable with ``-Dwith_skala=true``
  (requires ``-Dwith_rpc=true``).
- UmaPot evaluates UMA / OMol from an AOTInductor ``.pt2`` (``scripts/export_uma_aoti.py``): vesin builds the neighbor list, the compiled graph returns energy and forces. Charge and spin are per-call tensor inputs. One ``.pt2`` is exported per composition (``merge_mole``); the sidecar records cutoff, neighbors, task, charge, spin, ``z_set``, and label. ``scripts/export_baker_uma_aoti.py`` walks Baker endpoints and deduplicates by ``(z_set, charge, spin)``. potserv accepts ``Uma:<model.pt2>`` and ``Uma:<model.pt2>:<task>``.

### Fixed

- CI pins snapper-fmt to v0.10.0. Latest 0.11.2 panics on UTF-8 in org files.
- Metatomic-enabled build-tree executables locate Torch and metatomic shared
  libraries without an ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` override.
- UmaPot clears PT_GNU_STACK PF_X on AOTI wrapper.so before dlopen, so Elja-traced ``.pt2`` packages load on hosts that refuse an executable stack. ``scripts/export_uma_aoti.py`` applies the same rewrite at mint time.


## [3.1.2](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/3.1.2) - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- D3/D4 in the wheel are built from pinned meson wraps (static s-dftd3 / dftd4), not a conda prefix. The dftd4 wrap uses OpenBLAS as its LAPACK. ``pip install`` no longer needs vendored ``libblas`` from micromamba.


## [3.1.1](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/3.1.1) - 2026-09-04

### Added

- The PyPI wheel compiles ExprPot, D3Pot, D4Pot, and XcKernel and vendors ``s-dftd3`` / ``dftd4``. ``import rgpot`` exposes those classes (``has_expr`` / ``has_dftd3`` / ``has_dftd4`` / ``has_xckernel``).


## [3.1.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/3.1.0) - 2026-09-04

### Added

- A wheels workflow builds and publishes the Python package. rgpot had none:
  2.5.4 reached PyPI hand-built from a branch, with no tag and no
  main-branch source behind it, which is how the version surfaces drifted
  apart in the first place. A `v*` tag now builds manylinux and macOS
  wheels plus an sdist with cibuildwheel and publishes them; a manual run
  defaults to TestPyPI so an upload can be rehearsed before the
  irreversible one.

  The build step refuses a wheel whose `librgpot` carries fewer than the
  eight Fortran `bind(c)` entry points, so the potentials cannot silently
  fall out of the artifact again.
- Add `scripts/time_lj_rgpot_vs_pyeonclient.py` to time in-process `LJPot`
  against pyeonclient `Matter` on the ExprPotTest two-atom LJ fixture.
- D3Pot wraps the s-dftd3 ISO C API (``-Dwith_dftd3=true``, pixi env ``dftd3``). Config selects BJ/zero damping, a functional key, and an explicit ATM three-body flag. In-process Potential summand; no ``PotentialConfig.d3`` arm.
- D4Pot wraps the dftd4 ISO C API (``-Dwith_dftd4=true``, pixi env ``dftd4``). Config selects a functional key, total charge, and an explicit ATM/many-body flag. In-process Potential summand; no ``PotentialConfig.d4`` arm.
- ExprPot algebra goldens pin identity ``lj``, ``0.5*lj + morse``, ``2*lj - lj``, and ``0.5*(lj+morse)`` under ``CppCore/tests/data/expr/`` (energy 1e-14 eV, forces 1e-12 eV/A). Missing fixtures fail closed. Optional ``0.5*lj + d3`` when ``-Dwith_dftd3=true``.
- ExprPot compiles a Lepton energy string over named ``unique_ptr<PotentialBase>`` children (``-Dwith_expr=true``). Construct-time name checks fail closed. No PotentialConfig arm, no XcKernel term.
- ExprPot forces use analytic Lepton ``differentiate(name)`` weights compiled at construct: ``F = sum_i (df/dE_i) F_i``. No finite difference, no muParser.
- ExprPot wraps through ``PotentialHandle::from_impl`` / ``rgpot_potential_new_eindir`` as one eindir objective. A single ``rgpot_potential_calculate`` returns ``0.5*lj + morse``.
- Golden masters pin D3 BJ ATM on/off and D4 PBE energy and forces against s-dftd3 / dftd4 on a water-octamer cube (``meson test --suite dftd``).
- In-process `XcKernel` contracts Libxc derivative arrays into AO XC Fock and fxc matrices via the libxckernel C ABI (`-Dwith_xckernel=true`, off by default). This is not a `Potential` and has no `PotentialConfig` arm.
- Optional conda-forge s-dftd3 / dftd4 gates (``-Dwith_dftd3`` / ``-Dwith_dftd4``, pixi features ``dftd3`` / ``dftd4``). Default workspace and wheel stay free of those libraries.
- Optional vendored OpenMM Lepton gate (``-Dwith_expr``, ``third_party/lepton``). Default workspace and wheel stay free of Lepton object code.
- RPC/config can name a recursive ``ExprParams`` / ``PotSpec`` tree (for example ``0.5*lj + d3``). ``PotentialConfig`` stays a single-backend configure union. The C++ ``ExprPot`` constructor remains the first-slice API.
- TDA pin operator (H2O/sto-3g singlet roots) is also compared to libnwchemc ``task tddft`` / TDA via ``scripts/compare_xckernel_tda_nwchemc.py``. Exclusive sigma contraction stays 1e-17; the nwchemc root residual is the measured engine value (1e-6).
- `Potential::forceBatch` evaluates several independent systems in one call.
  The default `forceBatchImpl` loops over `forceImpl`, so every existing kernel answers a batch without an override.
  When the result cache is on, hits are served per system and only the misses reach the kernel as one compact batch.
- `XcKernel` assembles TDA and RPA sigma over the singlet `st_o2_p` C kernels plus host Coulomb, matching the PySCF `lib.einsum` contraction path and `eval_rho` (`ao @ dm`). The meson golden and live `TDA.gen_vind` / `gen_tdhf_operation` both meet exclusive 1e-17 against those committed sigma pins.
- `rgpot-core` can load any minimum-profile backend by prefix, keep one persistent session, and exchange the shared `PotentialConfig`, `ForceInput`, and `PotentialResult` carriers in-process.

### Changed

- Docs credit Antics and load only `antics.js`; Umami tracker and label are gone.
- The 1 MiB large-file CI gate now allowlists ``CppCore/tests/data/``, ``third_party/``, and ``pixi.lock`` (XcKernel goldens and the lockfile). Other tracked files still fail at 1 MiB.

### Fixed

- D3Pot now passes a sigma buffer to ``dftd3_get_dispersion`` so s-dftd3 fills the gradient (forces were previously left at zero).
- GGA TDA/RPA ``applyFxc`` keeps the generated 7-term monomials on the host long-double evaluator so C matches live ``gen_vind`` at exclusive 1e-17.
- LDA TDA/RPA fxc forms `wv = w * rho * (v2rho2_0 + v2rho2_1)` and tiles
  stage B at PySCF `BLKSIZE` (128). `--tda-rpa` pins host J from the
  `get_j` call inside `gen_vind` / `gen_tdhf_operation`.
- The cp312 wheel now carries the `abi3` tag: `tool.meson-python.limited-api`
  declares the stable-ABI build to meson-python, so one cp312-abi3 wheel
  installs on every CPython >= 3.12 instead of 3.12 alone.
- The metatomic torch dependency links on macOS. Its link arguments carried
  `-rpath-link` and `--as-needed`, which are GNU ld only: Apple's linker
  rejects them outright, so any Darwin build with `-Dwith_metatomic=true`
  died with "unknown options" while producing `librgpot.3.dylib`. Those
  flags now apply on GNU linkers only; Apple's resolves the dylibs from the
  library path and their install names.
- Wheel publish falls back to the `pypi-rgpot` / `testpypi-rgpot`
  `PYPI_TOKEN` until a matching trusted publisher is registered.

  cibuildwheel `build` must be a space-separated string so cp310, cp311,
  and the cp312 abi3 wheel all ship (a TOML array only built cp310).
- `--pyscf` Fock live-PySCF regen now fails above exclusive 1e-15 after long-double stage A/B (mGGA-tau float64 einsum was 1.50e-15).
- `--tda-rpa` keeps committed TDA/RPA host-J pins. Live `get_j` jitters
  about 1e-15 on this case and is reported, not written over the Coulomb
  pin the exclusive 1e-17 C compare uses.
- `--tda-rpa` now writes same-SCF extras and MANIFEST before the exclusive 1e-17 live-vs-committed gate; sigma/J pins are the MO-replay `gen_vind` / `get_j` (a fresh RKS is not bit-stable at that scale).
- `--tda-rpa` regen pins PySCF to one OpenMP thread and replays committed MOs so live `gen_vind` / `gen_tdhf_operation` can meet exclusive 1e-17 against the sigma pins.


## [3.0.2](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/3.0.2) - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Windows MSVC builds Cap'n Proto with lean windows.h defines, and links Flang pot kernels through MSVC lib.exe archives so llvm-ar no longer triggers LNK1107. ([#61](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/61))
- MetatomicPot no longer fails to load exported PET-MAD (and similar) models on metatensor-torch 0.10.3: scripted modules without `_mts_buffer_names` no longer trip the mixed-dict `.to()` walk.
- Python 3.x wheels import without torch: fat MetatomicPot is no longer
  `link_whole`'d into `librgpot` when `with_python` (engine stays dlopen-only),
  and the repair step ships `librgpot.so.3` (mesonpy zip dropped the soname link)
  plus a RUNPATH into site-packages torch/metatensor/vesin.


## [3.0.1](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/3.0.1) - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- The Python wheel builds the Fortran 2018 potentials. `[tool.meson-python.args]`
  never passed `-Dwith_fortran_pots`, so a wheel carried a `librgpot` with no
  Fortran-backed potential in it -- SW, EDIP, Lenosky, Tersoff, EAM-Al, FeHe,
  CuH2, and TIP4P-H were all missing from the one artifact most users install.
  The cibuildwheel configuration installs a Fortran compiler in the build
  image to match, and the repair step vendors `libgfortran` as it would any
  other dependency.


## [3.0.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/3.0.0) - 2026-07-26

### Added

- Pot-hosting groundwork for absorbing eOn's potential kernels:
  `PotCaps` capability descriptors (`PotentialBase::caps()`) replace
  caller-side thread-safety lists; `paramsKey()` parameter fingerprints
  (FNV-1a + kernel-version salt) join the result-cache key so instances
  with different parameters never share entries; `LJConfig` establishes
  the plain-aggregate parameter convention; a `pot_bench` Catch2
  microbenchmark harness gates future pot migrations; `potctl` locksteps
  `pyproject.toml`. ([#57](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/57))
- Eight potentials absorbed from eOn arrive as Fortran 2018 kernels under
  `CppCore/rgpot/fortran/`: Stillinger-Weber, EDIP, Lenosky, Tersoff, EAM
  aluminium, FeHe, CuH2, and TIP4P-H. Each is a rewrite rather than a
  wrapper -- modules with `implicit none`, derived-type parameters in place
  of COMMON blocks, kinds from `iso_fortran_env` asserted against the C
  types at compile time, `intent` on every argument, `pure` kernels,
  structured control flow, and status returns instead of `stop`.

  Neighbours come from vesin through `rgpot_neighbors`, a CSR full-list
  table carrying pair vectors and distances, and the vendored vesin Fortran
  interface gained the C API's Verlet `skin` option so the kernels keep the
  list caching their predecessors had. Pair sums are restated as gathers:
  each atom accumulates the whole force acting on it and writes one column,
  so the atom loops run under `do concurrent`. Bond-order and embedding
  kernels reach the same form in three passes, since the environment
  derivative is not known until its sum completes.

  Each kernel carries a Fortran-only test (translation invariance, zero net
  force, analytic forces against central differences of the energy) and is
  pinned in `FortranPotsTest` to the reference energies of the kernels it
  replaces. The kernel archives link under `--exclude-libs`, so no Fortran
  symbol reaches the library interface; a test fails the suite if one ever
  does.
- Three classical potentials absorbed from eOn, always built: `MorsePot`
  (pairwise Morse with the shifted cutoff, platinum defaults through
  `MorseConfig`), `LJClusterPot` (12-6 Lennard-Jones on free boundaries,
  `LJClusterConfig`), and `ZBLPot` (screened nuclear repulsion with the
  LAMMPS switching function, `ZBLConfig{cut_inner, cut_global}`, which
  rejects a cutoff pair outside `0 < cut_inner < cut_global`). All three
  take their pairs from the shared `PairListCache`, carry `paramsKey()`
  fingerprints, and appear in `pot_bench`. `PotType` gains `Morse`,
  `LJCluster` and `ZBL`.

### Changed

- `LJPot` pair search goes through `rgpot::nlist::PairListCache` (header-only
  port of eOn's PairListCache): Verlet-skin cached candidate lists in a
  process-global proximity-matched pool, lazy list capture so one-shot
  evaluations run a single fused scan, exact per-call MIC folding, and the
  inverse-r2 pair math instead of `pow()`/`sqrt()`. Boxes where MIC caching
  is unsound keep the historical per-call scan. ([#56](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/56))
- One versioned `librgpot.so.3` umbrella: every pot builds as a PIC static
  convenience library folded in via `link_whole`; only dlopen'd engine
  plugins ship as separate shared objects. `rgpot.pc` always installs when
  rgpot is the top-level project, exporting the umbrella with
  `RGPOT_HAS_*` feature cflags. vesin resolves once at top level
  (installed >=0.6 preferred, vendored `third_party/vesin` fallback with
  the Fortran interface), and the new `with_fortran_pots` feature
  decouples Fortran-backed potentials from the RPC role options.
  Statistics counters in `registry<T>` are atomic, and public headers no
  longer inject `AtomMatrix` at namespace scope. CI gains the first
  Windows leg and an offline `--wrap-mode=nodownload` rehearsal of the
  release-tarball build. ([#57](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/57))
- The Cap'n Proto schema ships inside `librgpot` instead of a separate
  `libptlrpc.so`. Consumers that bundle the umbrella alone -- pip wheels
  especially -- no longer need a second shared object beside it, and
  `rgpot.pc` correspondingly stops listing `-lptlrpc`; the symbols are
  unchanged and still exported from `librgpot`. `potserv` and
  `pot_client_bridge` take the generated translation unit from the shared
  archive rather than compiling their own copy.
- The CuH2 potential is the in-tree Fortran 2018 kernel
  (`CppCore/rgpot/fortran/rgpot_cuh2.f90`), reached through
  `rgpot::fortranpots::CuH2Pot` from `rgpot/fortran/FortranPots.hpp`. It
  matches the energy and forces of the kernel it replaces to 1e-6 on the
  geometry `CuH2PotTest` pins. `rgpot::CuH2Pot` and
  `rgpot/CuH2/CuH2Pot.hpp` are gone, and with them the `fortcuh2`
  subproject and its wrap-git entry, so a source build needs no download
  for the Fortran pots and the offline `--wrap-mode=nodownload` CI leg
  covers them. `rgpot/CuH2/cuh2Utils.hpp` keeps the slab-geometry helpers
  unchanged. In-tree sources gate the Fortran pots on
  `RGPOT_HAS_FORTRAN_POTS`, the same cflag `rgpot.pc` exports to
  consumers.

### Fixed

- `potctl`'s lockstep check now covers `pyproject.toml`, so the Python
  package version cannot drift away from meson, CMake, cargo, pixi, and
  towncrier again. It had: 2.5.4 went to PyPI as a multi-ABI wheel set
  (torch 2.7 through 2.13) while every other surface stayed at 2.5.3. All
  six now read the same version, and the check fails the build when they
  do not. ([#52](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/52))
- Four link-layout defects in the umbrella build, each of which only
  surfaced in a profile that combines the RPC stack with the Fortran
  potentials:

  - Every convenience archive carried its own copy of the vendored vesin
    translation unit, because meson copies a static library's objects into
    each static library that links it, so the umbrella saw multiple
    definitions of vesin's thread-local error state. The archives take a
    headers-only view now and the objects enter `librgpot` -- and each leaf
    binary -- exactly once.
  - `librgpot` linked without the Fortran runtime: it is a C++ target that
    takes the kernels through `link_whole`, which leaves meson no Fortran
    source to infer the runtime from. It is now named per compiler id.
  - `ptlrpc_dep` exported the generated capnp `.cpp` as a dependency source,
    compiling a second copy of that translation unit into every consumer.
    Only the generated header propagates.
  - The umbrella exported the RPC entry points only when something inside
    `librgpot` happened to reference them; they are folded in with
    `link_whole` now, since it is consumers that call them.
- The RPC integration test compares the CuH2 energy and forces at the same
  1e-6 tolerance `CuH2PotTest` uses, instead of asserting exact float
  equality against values from the kernel the Fortran 2018 rewrite replaced.
  Its error path also kills the server before draining its output: reading a
  live server's stderr blocks until that process exits, so an assertion
  failure did not report itself, it sat until the six-hour CI timeout. The
  handler now prints the exception type and traceback as well, since
  `AssertionError` stringifies to nothing.
- The strict-determinism metatomic test no longer requires two matched force
  calls to agree bit for bit, because the provider does not offer that.
  Instrumenting the path shows rgpot handing the model identical inputs --
  positions, cell, and neighbour list all hash the same on every SO3 pass of
  both calls -- and getting energies back that differ by one to two ulp on a
  call chosen at random. It reproduces with `OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`, with the
  TorchScript profiling executor frozen, and with the pair vectors copied
  into torch-owned storage, so it is neither thread-count reassociation, nor
  graph specialization, nor alignment of the buffers rgpot passes in. The
  test now bounds the energy at four ulp and the force components at an
  absolute floor scaled to the largest component, which still fails on any
  drift larger than the provider's own noise.
- The vendored vesin Fortran interface builds under LLVM Flang on Windows.
  It bound `vesin_neighbors` directly, which takes the device and options
  structs by value; Flang cannot lower a by-value `BIND(C)` derived type on
  the `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` target and aborts the compiler outright
  ("not yet implemented: passing VALUE BIND(C) derived type for this
  target"), so no Fortran consumer of vesin could be built there at all.
  vesin gains `vesin_neighbors_byref`, which takes both structs through
  pointers and forwards them by value, and the Fortran module binds to that.
  Marked as an upstream candidate alongside the other local vesin patches.


## [2.5.3](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.5.3) - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- Fix ``-Dwith_rpc_client_only=true -Dwith_tests=true``: use ``pot_bridge_dep``
  (was undefined ``rgpot_bridge_dep``), link ``units.cc`` into unit tests when
  ``rgpot_core`` is not built, and soft-skip bridge stress cases when potserv is
  not running (lazy client connect). Catch2 configure/link/test succeed for the
  client frontend product without a live server.


## [2.5.2](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.5.2) - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Rebuild Metatomic engines against vesin 0.6+ ``VesinOptions`` (``skin`` /
  ``n_threads``) so ``vesin_neighbors`` no longer fails with a bare error when
  runtime libvesin is 0.6 and the engine was built for 0.5.


## [2.5.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.5.0) - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Multi-language Codecov coverage (Rust, C++, Python, Fortran) with OIDC uploads. ([#47](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/47))
- Install headers and ``rgpot.pc`` (``nwchempot`` / ``cpmdpot`` / ``ptlrpc``; no
  torch or xTB at link time) so eOn and other hosts can prefer
  ``dependency('rgpot')`` over the Meson subproject wrap. Engines stay runtime
  dlopen. See ``docs/eon_pkgconfig.md``.
- Keep Metatomic **dlopen** product on pip: portable `libmetatomic_engine.so` plugin (no eonclib) + `evaluate_metatomic` frontend (not LJ-only wheels).
- Metatomic dual path: linked ``MetatomicPot`` (fast) and ``MetatomicDlopen``
  frontend plus optional ``libmetatomic_engine.so`` C ABI (slow/plugin path).
- Metatomic engines are built for each supported torch major
  (``rgpot/lib/torch-X.Y/libmetatomic_engine.so``) and selected at runtime from
  the installed torch version — same multi-ABI model as metatomic-torch itself.
  The pip product covers **torch 2.7 and newer**; earlier majors are out of scope.
- MetatomicConfig gains an explicit ``torch_determinism`` policy
  (``TorchDeterminismPolicy::Fast`` default, ``Strict`` opt-in). Strict mode
  enables deterministic LibTorch algorithms, math-only scaled-dot-product
  attention (flash / memory-efficient / cuDNN SDP disabled), deterministic
  cuDNN with benchmarking off, deterministic fill of uninitialized memory, and
  disables TF32 for cuBLAS and cuDNN. These flags are process-global via
  ``at::globalContext()``; Fast never mutates them. CUDA hosts still need
  ``CUBLAS_WORKSPACE_CONFIG=:4096:8`` (or ``:16:8``) before the first cuBLAS
  call for bit-stable matmuls.
- Portable Metatomic engine wheels: `$ORIGIN` RUNPATH to site-packages torch/metatomic
  (single build-time torch major; multi-ABI package dirs cannot be listed oldest-first).
  `scripts/rgpot_build_wheel.sh` always runs RPATH repair after `python -m build`.
- Python bindings use **nanobind** with **stable ABI** (abi3 / Py_LIMITED_API 3.12)
  when built on Python >= 3.12 (same policy as pyeonclient). Metatomic engines are
  packed multi-ABI under ``rgpot/lib/torch-X.Y/`` and selected from the installed
  torch major at runtime. Supported libtorch majors start at **2.7** (engines for
  2.7–2.13 ship in the manylinux wheel); torch 2.6 and older are not bundled.
- Python package `rgpot` is pip-installable: core Lennard-Jones bindings via
  meson-python wheels (`import rgpot; rgpot.evaluate_lj(...)`), plus optional
  Metatomic multi-ABI engines for **torch 2.7+**.
- xTB dual backends: keep linked ``XTBPot`` and add ``XTBDlopen`` +
  ``libxtb_engine.so`` C ABI plugin (same pattern as metatomic engine).

### Fixed

- Metatomic C ABI engines soft-release the GIL so pyeonclient Job.run can evaluate forces under torch autograd without a fat metatomic link.
- SoftGilRelease in the metatomic C ABI only calls PyEval_SaveThread when PyGILState_Check is true, so nested GIL release from pyeonclient Job.run is safe.


## [2.2.1](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.2.1) - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Windows/MSVC builds no longer fail on unused ``cxxabi.h`` includes or nested
  ``std::array`` box flattening in ``Potential`` (``C1083`` / ``C2676``).


## [2.2.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.2.0) - 2026-07-05

### Added

- A profile-driven ABI loader (`rgpot::abi::ProfileLoader`) resolves the minimum
  potential ABI available from a single install prefix.

### Changed

- The canonical potentials-schema contract is pinned at v1.13.0, adding the
  Capabilities discovery surface; the in-tree `Potentials.capnp` copies track it
  byte-for-byte.

### Fixed

- `rgpot-core` publishes to crates.io again: `dlpk` (0.1.5) and `eindir-core`
  (0.5.0, `capi`) now resolve from the registry instead of git pins, and the
  `publish = false` guard is gone.


## [2.1.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.1.0) - 2026-07-03

### Added

- eOn integration: eOn ships an in-process `RgpotPot` potential (`-Dwith_rgpot=true`) that consumes rgpot's `NWChemPot` / `CPMDPot` frontends as a Meson subproject and `dlopen`s `libnwchemc` / `libcpmdc` directly, with `potserv` remaining available for out-of-process RPC. See `docs/orgmode/howto/eon-rgpot.org`.

### Changed

- The Cap'n Proto schema is pinned to canonical [potentials-schema](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/potentials-schema) v1.12.0: `MetatomicParams` arm (union ordinal 4) with the upstream requested-outputs surface, typed NWChem and CPMD parity batches (dplot/esp, prop/linres/pimd/path/tddft), `CommonMethodSpec` overlay, and a schema-sync CI gate that fails when the vendored copies diverge from the pinned release.

### Fixed

- Release-prepare CI no longer runs `cargo publish --dry-run` for `rgpot-core` while it depends on git-only `dlpk` / `eindir-core` (not on crates.io). The job uses `cargo check -p rgpot-core --locked`, and `package.publish` is `false` until registry deps exist. ([#42](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/42))


## [2.0.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/2.0.0) - 2026-06-26

> Channel note: `v2.0.0` was prepared on `main` but never tagged or published;
> the content below first ships in `v2.1.0`.

### Added

- NWChemPot backend: stable message-based C ABI (`nwchem_c_abi.h`), always-built frontend with `dlopen` of optional `libnwchemc`, stub ABI for CI without NWChem, Cap'n Proto `NWChemParams`/`configure @1`, and `potserv ... NWChem`.
- CPMDPot backend: always-built frontend with `dlopen` of optional `libcpmdc` (split [`cpmdc`](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/cpmdc) engine), Cap'n Proto `CPMDParams` / `PotentialConfig.cpmd` / `configure`, structured `CPMDInputSection` arms, in-tree `cpmdc_fake_engine` for CI without CPMD, and `potserv ... CPMD`. Engine lookup: `CPMDC_LIBRARY`, `RGPOT_CPMDC_ENGINE`, `RGPOT_CPMD_ENGINE`, then `enginePath` on params.
- rgpot potentials are now eindir objectives: `rgpot_potential_t` embeds eindir's `eindir_objective_t` as its first member (zero-cost IS-A), with the embedded eval/grad callbacks routed through the rgpot force callback (gradient = -force). rgpot-core consumes `eindir-core` as a shared Cargo crate rather than a prebuilt static lib, so downstream Rust consumers (e.g. `anneal-core`) can minimize an rgpot potential through `eindir_core::Objective<f64>` without a two-Rust-runtime conflict. See `docs/orgmode/howto/eindir-anneal.org`.

### Developer

- CI authoring uses a Nickel `ci/gha/` library with a single hand-maintained
  `ci-orchestrator.yml` for PR/main jobs (prepare/plan, hygiene, build/rust/bridge,
  potentials, CI gate), and nickel-exported workflows only for release, docs,
  cosmo potctl, and doc-commenter. Removed redundant `build`/`prek`/`potentials`/
  `docs_quality`/`towncrier`/`cosmo-potctl-spike` committed workflows in favor of
  the orchestrator plus `gen-gha`/`gha-drift` for the remaining exports. ([#40](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/40))

### Changed

- NWChemPot is now a pure consumer of the split [`nwchemc`](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/nwchemc) engine: the in-tree NWChem embed (`nwchem_c_abi.c`, `nwchem_embed_c_api.f90`, `nwchem_embed_legacy.F`) and the `-Dwith_nwchem`/`-Dnwchem_root`/`-Dnwchem_target` build options are removed. The frontend always builds and `dlopen`s `libnwchemc.so`; the capnp schema is synced byte-for-byte to nwchemc's canonical superset so a flat `NWChemParams` round-trips with no field loss.


## [1.2.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.2.0) - 2026-06-24

### Added

- XTBPot: GFN tight-binding via the xtb C API (GFNFF, GFN0/1/2-xTB). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_xtb=true``. RPC names ``XTB``, ``GFNFF``, ``GFN0xTB``, ``GFN1xTB``. ([#35](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/35))
- TBLitePot: GFN tight-binding via the tblite C API (GFN1, GFN2, IPEA1). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_tblite=true``. ([#36](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/36))
- MetatomicPot: load metatomic TorchScript models directly in C++ (vesin neighbor lists, autograd forces). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_metatomic=true``. Requires vesin 0.5+ (``VesinDevice{VesinCPU, 0}``). ([#37](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/37))
- Units module (``rgpot/units.hpp``): CODATA 2018 constants plus a runtime unit expression parser, with Cap'n Proto ``lengthUnit``/``energyUnit`` negotiation on the RPC boundary. ([#38](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/38))

### Developer

- Lockstep monorepo release via cocogitto 7 + towncrier + ``potctl`` (``potctl/``,
  not published): ``cog bump`` runs ``potctl release sync`` then towncrier then
  ``potctl release assert --require-changelog``; ``release.yml`` publishes
  ``rgpot-core`` on stable ``v*`` tags. CI ``potentials.yml`` builds xtb/tblite and
  metatomic/vesin backends.
- Release tooling in ``potctl`` (Rust workspace crate): lockstep assert
  (meson/CMake/cargo/towncrier/pixi), fail-fast CHANGELOG gate, ``release sync``
  writes all surfaces, cargo publish --locked only, RC tags skip crates.io,
  release-prepare cargo dry-run, SECURITY.md and CODEOWNERS for release surfaces.

### Fixed

- MetatomicPot: target vesin 0.5+ ``VesinDevice`` struct (``{VesinDeviceKind, device_id}``, pass ``VesinDevice{VesinCPU, 0}``) and zero-initialized ``VesinOptions`` (``sorted`` / ``algorithm``).


## [1.1.0](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.1.0) - 2026-03-29

### Added

- XTBPot: GFN tight-binding potential via xtb (GFNFF, GFN0, GFN1, GFN2). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_xtb=true``. ([#35](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/35))
- TBLitePot: GFN tight-binding potential via tblite (GFN1, GFN2, IPEA1). Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_tblite=true``. ([#36](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/36))
- MetatomicPot: ML atomistic models via metatomic/PyTorch with autograd forces and vesin neighbor lists. Feature-gated with ``-Dwith_metatomic=true``. ([#37](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/37))
- Shared unit conversion header (``rgpot/units.hpp``) with CODATA 2018 physical constants for Angstrom/Bohr, Hartree/eV, and Boltzmann conversions. ([#38](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/38))


## [1.0.3](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.0.3) - 2026-03-01

### Fixed

- MSVC/clang-cl compatibility: use ``/W3`` instead of GCC/Clang warning flags and skip ``-lstdc++`` link arg on Windows ([#31](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/31))


## [1.0.2](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/tree/1.0.2) - 2026-03-01

### Added

- External integration guide covering namespace collision mitigation when embedding rgpot as a subproject ([#30](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/30))

### Changed

- CI dependency bumps and cleanup to prevent trailing whitespace in generated headers ([#29](https://github.com/OmniPotentRPC/rgpot/issues/29))
