* About
This is a set of standard potentials in C++ or Fortran. The goal is to provide
minimal, binding friendly interfaces for ease of usage from Python or even R.
The core library is header-only, though adapt functions are provided for interfacing
to ~Eigen~ and ~xtensor~.

This was originally designed for interfacing easily to potentials implemented [[http://theory.cm.utexas.edu/eon/][in
eOn]], but has grown to be more flexible.

*** Developing locally
A ~pre-commit~ job is setup on CI to enforce consistent styles, so it is best to
set it up locally as well (using [[https://pypa.github.io/pipx][pipx]] for isolation):

#+begin_src sh
# Run before commiting
pipx run pre-commit run --all-files
# Or install the git hook to enforce this
pipx run pre-commit install
#+end_src
* License
MIT, however note that some of the potentials are adapted from eOn which is
under a BSD 3-Clause License.
